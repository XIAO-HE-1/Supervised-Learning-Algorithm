## Supervised Learning Algorithm
This repository contains my understanding on some supervised learning algorithms and Python code for these algorithms.
1. K-Nearest Neighbor and Bias-Variance Trade-off  
2. Regularization(Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression)
3. Support Vector Machine
  * Part 1: Maximal Margin Classifier (Linear Seperable Case)
  * Part 2: Support Vector Classifier (Linear Non-Seperable Case)
  * Part 3: Support Vector Machine (Non-Linear Case)
